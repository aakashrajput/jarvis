# Voicebot

This is a simple web-based voicebot built against [api.ai](https://api.ai) backend. It implements a static client app, as well as a simple web service for doing math.

## Demo

This is running at [voicebot.jaanus.com.](https://voicebot.jaanus.com)

## How to run

This is a static web application. Run it with any local or cloud-based web server that can serve static files.

Due to browser voice API microphone security/permission requirements, itâ€™s best to run it over HTTPS, not plain HTTP. [From Google docs:](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API)

> Pages hosted on HTTPS do not need to ask repeatedly for permission, whereas HTTP hosted pages do.
